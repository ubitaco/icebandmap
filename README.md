# Ice Band Map

![Strategic View of Ice Band Map Example](http://lia.mna.sh/host/iceband.jpg "Strategic View")

This map script consists of a band of ice/snow along the equator. Players all spawn south of the equator. If you can manage the barbarian filled crossing, you will be rewarded with free land to colonize. As a script, it is randomly generated.
